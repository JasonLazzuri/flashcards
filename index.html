          <h2>Javascript</h2>
          <p id="js">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.</p>

          <h2>Operators</h2>
          <p id="ops">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>

        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h2>Variables</h2>
          <p id="vars">Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.</p>
          <button id="var"> Reveal</button>

        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h2>Naming Convention</h2>
          <p id="names">In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>

          <h2>Functions</h2>
          <p id="funs">functions are declared with the following syntax: function functionName(parameters) { code to be executed. ... Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p id="mets">JavaScript methods are the actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Property. Value.</p>

          <h2>Arguments</h2>
          <p id="args">JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).</p>

          <h2>Return</h2>
          <p>Definition and Usage. The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function. Read our JavaScript Tutorial to learn all you need to know about functions. ...

          <h2>Chaining methods</h2>
          <p>Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>

        <div class = "col-md-2">
          <h2>Strings</h2>
          <p>Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.</p>

          <h2>Booleans</h2>
          <p>The Boolean Object. Advertisements. The Boolean object represents two values, either "true" or "false". If value parameter is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false.</p>

        <h2>Undefined</h2>

      <div class = "col-md-2">
        <h2>NaN</h2>
        <p>NaN is a property of the global object. The initial value of NaN is Not-A-Number — the same as the value of Number.NaN . In modern browsers, NaN is a non-configurable, non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.</p>

      <div class = "col-md-2">
        <h2>Escape</h2>
        <p>An escape character is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters. Generally, the judgment of whether something is an escape character or not depends on context.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "col-md-2">
        <h2>Alert</h2>
        <p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>

        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable. JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.</p>
